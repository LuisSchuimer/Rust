# My Rust leaning experience

Since some months now, I want to learn a **more low level programing language**. I came across Rust and directly got to work.
The thing I noticed was that it is harder to learn than **Python**, a language I learned about 4 years ago. 

Rust is a language, that is low level and it also implements new features and workflows that I didn't know before
or that are unique in Rust. 

With this repository, I want to log my progress learning **Rust**. Every script I write will be pushed here, so that
sometime in the future, I can look back to my fist steps in this (for me) **beautiful language**.

### How will I learn this language?
The thing is, I don't want to learn Rust the same way as Python. I thought: *"Learning by doing is great and that's the only thing that is
important for my learning process"*. Learning my doing is good, but shouldn't be the only way to learn something. It should be a process that
is a good balance between **reading** and **doing**. You need a basis for learning everything that you need, to understand a language at it's fullest.

And that is something that I want to make reality in my Rust learning process. **Understanding the language at it's fullest.**
